## Blender Geometry nodes: A demonstration for architecture

Blender Geometry nodes is the language of 3D modelling and learning it akin to learning you have scissors when opening some hard plastic packaging; realising it doesnt have to be this hard. 
In this post I want to explain my functions that allows me to create european apartments. My goals when creating this function were the following: 
* The function must not be destructive to the shape of the object it is applied to. This permits me to create buildings of all different shapes, a feature that quickly becomes important when building on plots of varying shape.
* Procedurally create windows and door frames.
* Support for tiled and metal roofs
* Support for skirting.
