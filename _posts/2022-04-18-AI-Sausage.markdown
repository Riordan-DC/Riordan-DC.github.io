why did we call it machine LEARNING or artificial INTELLIGENCE? these words taunt us to again discuss the nature of intelligence. If GPT-4 was made with hand crafted features we wouldnt have the same discussion on the nature of intelligence everytime a big neural network surprises us. future historians studying twitter's corpse will call this ritual and ponder why these chimps go through this dance every day, week, month, year. Like presenting a magic trick the winner is the laymen and much like magic our discussion on the nature of intelligence will never end. maybe the word is reaching for something a single word cannot grasp. Something contextual.
