RL Algorithm Design
-------------------

Acting is evaluation, is planning, is prediction
-------------------

Exploring is anomaly detection, is curiosity, is model learning
-------------------

RL Exploration concept is a Monte Carlo search. we approximate expected value where the value is the gradient of a successful reward function.
Exploration is like gradient descent gradient descent
Exploration is a proxy for an intractable gradient
All learning is useful. There are no stupid answers.
