## Deterministic Drivers

I often hear that autonomous vehicles don't need to be perfect, they just need to be bette than humans. 
I agree. However, imagine 10 cars driving the same road. 
The first, although has a 99% success rate, fails this turn. The following 9 cars, 
using the same model, produce the same action, and fail the same. 
That is a bit more scary than the nebulous 1% failure rate. 
Of course the solution is to have cars communicate with each other and allow cars to record these edge cases and report them to the manufacturer.
