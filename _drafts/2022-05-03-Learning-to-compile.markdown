I'd love to make a game where you control little robotic agents exclusivly with written language.
You write their little programs and they execute them. The robots can learn and become better
at executing an action over time and with instruction.
Im imagining a topdown view like and RTS or overcooked and you can write an instruction into
each of your little automated golems and they will perhaps each instruction in a sequence before
restarting their programming.
