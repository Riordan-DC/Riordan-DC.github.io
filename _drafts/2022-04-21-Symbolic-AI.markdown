Abstract: Symbolic and distributed AI methods are groups we find easy to allocate. Symbolic methods focus on leveraging hand crafted features and programming whereas distributed methods use an optimiser to search for procedural features and programming. Often (citation needed) researchers argue the dominance of one method over the other. We feel defensive of our methods and eager to argue that our field of research engulfs the other. In truth they are tools of design and one will never replace another as they have equal and distinct value.

Any distributed system can be improved with symbols for control.

Examples:
* An autonomous vehicle. Commaai's George Hotz says we cant explain driving to a car, it must learn through driving itself. This is weak and rigid AI design.
Can we learn banking software? Of course. Can we change the parameters after training? with great difficulty. 

because driving is a low level control task that operates in parallel with a dynamic rule based system. These rules vary by location but the low level control is the same everywhere.  This is true if any task consists of equally learnable and distinct sub-tasks. Unfortunantly the task of maintaining your lane is not a scaled down task of comprehending a sign and following its rules.
